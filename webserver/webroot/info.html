    <h1>Our Information Collection</h1>
    <h3>From The Beginning</h3>
    <p>&emsp;Our information retrieval begins with the use of Jonathan Miner's trackcar. Jon Miner and the
    PiRail team use the trackcar to visit different railways in New Hampshire and Maine. To collect the
    information, Jon created a data collection device with includes a Rapberry Pi, mobile battery, GPS
    antenna, and LIDAR sensor. The information is then transfered from the Raspberry Pi to a server where
    Jon can access his recently recorded data. With the help of UNH students, Jon has been able to expand
    the PiRail integrated software to be more user friendly and include data analyzing techniques.</p>
    <h3>Current Day</h3>
    <p>&emsp;With the expansion of the PiRail software, the PiRail team has focused on user-friendly software
        and data analyzing. The PiRail software is able to take large datasets with millions of data points
    and calculate various averages, minimums, maximums, and outliers for all axis points. This analysis is
    then transfered to a graph which the user can then use to analyze specific points along the track that
    may need to be maintenanced. </p>
    <h3>Further Analysis</h3>
    <p>&emsp;PiRail continues to simplify the future of railroad maintenance with easy to use software,
        reliability and a dedicated team to enhance our tools and features for professionals. We look to
        further implement our analysis software to include more reliable and usable components to further
    enable users to respond quickly to dangerous track conditions.</p>
