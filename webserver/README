The GIT respository does not include the data files.

You can get the wrr_20211016_westbound.json file from
the "Sample Data" directory in the UNH Capstone 2023 directory:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19CUF746Ex-H-uH54zxhxy8JhtKGV_HN9?usp=sharing

There are two options:

1) Copy the file into the track-charts/webserver/PIRAIL/20211016 directory

2) Copy the file somewhere else on your system, and edit the
   launch.sh script to set the PIRAILDATA environment variable to
   the directory where you put it.

NOTE: The PIRAILDATA environment variable is a colon separated
      list of top level directories, which contain a number of
      subdirectories in the "YYYYmmdd" format.
