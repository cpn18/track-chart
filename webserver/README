The GIT respository does not include the data files.

You can get the wrr_20211016_westbound.json file from
the "Sample Data" directory in the UNH Capstone 2023 directory:

There are two options:

1) Copy the file into the track-charts/webserver/data directory

2) Copy the file somewhere else on your system, and edit the
   launch.sh script to set the PIRAILDATA environment variable to
   the directory where you put it.
